It was that beast which, in the Good Book, is called the Leviathan, and if it had been measured in our day, its tail would have touched Iceland, while its snout rested on the North Cape.

So six-and-thirty Champions arrived at the King's Palace, each hoping to gain the prize.  But the King sent them all out to look at the Giant Stoorworm lying in the sea with its enormous mouth open, and when they saw it, twelve of them were seized with sudden illness, and twelve of them were so afraid that they took to their heels and ran, and never stopped till they reached their own countries; and so only twelve returned to the King's Palace, and as for them, they were so downcast at the thought of the task that they had undertaken that they had no spirit left in them at all.  And none of them dare try to kill the Stoorworm; so the three weeks passed slowly by, until the night before the day on which the Princess was to be sacrificed. On that night the King, feeling that he must do something to entertain his guests, made a great supper for them.This was too much for the boatman. Forgetting all about his head and the King, he jumped out of the boat, and, pushing Assipattle aside, began to scrape among the sand with all his might.   While he was doing so, Assipattle seized his pot, jumped into the boat, pushed her off, and was half a mile out to sea before the outwitted man, who, needless to say, could find no gold, noticed what he was about.  And, of course, he was very angry, and the old King was more angry still when he came down to the shore, attended by his Nobles and carrying the great sword Sickersnapper, in the vain hope that he, poor feeble old man that he was, might be able in some way to defeat the Monster and save his daughter.  But to make such an attempt was beyond his power now that his boat was gone. So he could only stand on the shore, along with the fast assembling crowd of his subjects, and watch what would befall.  And this was what befell!Woe's me! but there was a conflagration! And Assipattle just got back to his boat in time; for the Mester Stoorworm, in its convulsions, threw the boat right out of its mouth again, and it was flung up, high and dry, on the bare land.  The commotion in the sea was so terrible that the King and his daughter--who by this time had come down to the shore dressed like a bride, in white, ready to be thrown to the Monster--and all his Courtiers, and all the country-folk, were fain to take refuge on the hill top, out of harm's way, and stand and see what happened next.

However, upon witnessing the Giant Stoorworm in the sea with its massive mouth open, twelve Champions succumbed to sudden illness, while another twelve fled in terror to their homelands. The remaining twelve returned to the Palace, but their spirits were so broken that none dared to challenge the Stoorworm. As the three weeks deadline approached, on the night before the Princess's scheduled sacrifice, the King hosted a great supper for his guests.

The voice of the bird rose and fell, and circled round and round, but whithersoever floated or spread out its notes, they seemed ever to have their center where Minda sat; and she looked with sad eyes into the sad eyes of the mournful bird, that sat in his red and deep-blue plumage just opposite to the flowery bank.

The poor bird strove more and more with his voice, and seemed ever more and more anxiously to address his notes of lament to Minda's ear, till at last she could not refrain from saying, \"What aileth thee, sad bird?\"As if he had but waited to be spoken to, the bird left his branch, and alighting upon the bank, smiled on Minda, and, shaking his shining plumage, answered:  \"I am bound in this condition until a maiden shall accept me in marriage.

She returned to the lodge later than usual, but she was too timid to speak to her mother of that which the bird had charged her.

I have done that for which I was sent. I am permitted to take with me the one whom I love. I have found your daughter ever kind, gentle and just. She shall be my companion. The blessing of the Good Spirit be ever with you. Farewell, my mother-my brother, farewell.\"  While the widow woman was still lost in wonder at these words, Monedowa, and Minda his wife, changed at the same moment, rose into the air, as beautiful birds, clothed in shining colors of red and blue.",

The bird's first notes were extraordinarily delicious to her ears, its song uniquely captivating and resembling a human voice expressing mournful melody, as if it bewailed its inability to communicate more clearly. The bird's notes rose and fell, circling round and round, but they always seemed to center around where Minda sat, their sad eyes meeting in shared melancholy across the flowery bank. When Minda finally addressed the bird's sorrow, it immediately left its branch, alighted near her, and revealed its true nature: it was bound in bird form until a maiden would accept it in marriage. The bird had sung to many Indian girls throughout the groves, but only Minda had heeded its voice. It requested her to seek her mother's consent for their marriage, promising to reveal its true self once freed, and poured forth a flood of melody that sparkled and spread across the scene, entrancing the silent Minda. During their subsequent meetings in the wood, the bird sang beautiful forest notes and engaged in gentle human discourse with Minda during each pause, asking about her home, family, and the little incidents of her daily life. Though she returned to these encounters with increasing pleasure, staying later than usual, she remained too timid to speak to her mother about the marriage proposal the bird continuously besought her to discuss. Eventually, when the widow's family departed the area, they reached the same fragrant bank and evergreen wood where Minda had first met her bird lover. There, the bird revealed himself as Monedowa, explaining to Minda's mother that the Good Spirit had sent him to be their friend. Having completed his mission and found Minda to be kind, gentle, and just, he announced that they must now leave together.

Although the country furnished an abundance of game, and whatever else a good heart could wish for, it was the study of this wicked genius to destroy such as fell into his hands. He made use of all his arts to decoy men into his power, for the purpose of killing them. The country had been once thickly peopled, but this Mudjee Monedo had so thinned it by his cruel practices, that he now lived almost solitary in the wilderness.  The secret of his success lay in his great speed. He had the power to assume the shape of any four-footed creature, and it was his custom to challenge such as he sought to destroy, to run with him. He had a beaten path on which he ran, leading around a large lake, and he always ran around this circle so that the starting and the winning-post was the same.As soon as the mudjee monedo arrived, he eyed this strange warrior whom he had never seen before; but he dissembled, as usual, and, with a gentle laugh, said to the widow, \"Did I not tell you that some one was staying with you, for I knew your son was too young to hunt.\"  The widow excused herself by saying that she did not think it necessary to tell him, inasmuch as he was a manito, and must have known before he asked.  The manito was very pleasant with Monedowa, and after much other discourse, in a gentle-spoken voice, he invited him to the racing-ground, saying it was a manly amusement, that he would have an excellent chance to meet there with other warriors, and that he should himself be pleased to run with him.  Monedowa would have excused himself, saying that he knew nothing of running.  \"Why,\" replied the mudjee monedo, trembling in every limb as he spoke, \"don't you see how old I look, while you are young and full of life. We must at least run a little to amuse others.\"  \"Be it so, then,\" replied Monedowa. \"I will oblige you.

Sometimes, indeed, he never came at all, and the next evening\rhe would tell Tephany that he had been forced to go into the town on\rbusiness, but though she never reproached him she was not deceived and\rsaw plainly that he no longer cared for her as he used to do.Day by day her heart grew heavier and her cheeks paler, and one evening,\rwhen she had waited for him in vain, she put her water-pot on her\rshoulder and went slowly down to the spring. On the path in front of her\rstood the fairy who had given her the pin, and as she glanced at Tephany\rshe gave a little mischievous laugh and said:\r\r'Why, my pretty maiden hardly looks happier than she did before, in\rspite of meeting her lover whenever she pleases.'\r\r'He has grown tired of me,' answered Tephany in a trembling voice, 'and\rhe makes excuses to stay away.

While Denis initially seemed to enjoy their time together as much as she did, his interest waned after he had shared all his songs and ambitious plans for wealth and success. He grew increasingly disinterested in their conversations, preferring to speak rather than listen. His absences became more frequent, with claims of town business serving as excuses.

When he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden.  \"What are you doing here?\" he cried in a very gruff voice, and the children ran away.  \"My own garden is my own garden,\" said the Giant; \"any one can understand that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself.\" So he built a high wall all round it, and put up a notice-board.He was a very selfish Giant.  The poor children had now nowhere to play. They tried to play on the road, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did not like it. They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside. \"How happy we were there,\" they said to each other.  Then the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds. Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter. The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom. Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to sleep.

One morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music. It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the King's musicians passing by. It was really only a little linnet singing outside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world. Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind ceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement. \"I believe the Spring has come at last,\" said the Giant; and he jumped out of bed and looked out.What did he see?  He saw a most wonderful sight. Through a little hole in the wall the children had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches of the trees. In every tree that he could see there was a little child. And the trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms, and were waving their arms gently above the children's heads. The birds were flying about and twittering with delight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and laughing. It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still winter. It was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little boy. He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly. The poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was blowing and roaring above it.\"Climb up! little boy,\" said the Tree, and it bent its branches down as low as it could; but the boy was too tiny.  And the Giant's heart melted as he looked out. \"How selfish I have been!\" he said; \"now I know why the Spring would not come here. I will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children's playground for ever and ever.\" He was really very sorry for what he had done.  So he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and went out into the garden. But when the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again.

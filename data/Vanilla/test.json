The huntsmen went in, and then came back and said, 'In the hollow tree there lies a wonderful animal that we don't know, and we have never seen one like it; its skin is made of a thousand pieces of fur; but it is lying down asleep.' The King said, 'See if you can catch it alive, and then fasten it to the cart, and we will take it with us.' When the huntsmen seized the maiden, she awoke and was frightened, and cried out to them, 'I am a poor child, forsaken by father and mother; take pity on me, and let me go with you.' Then they said to her, 'Many-furred Creature, you can work in the kitchen; come with us and sweep the ashes together.' So they put her in the cart and they went back to the palace. There they showed her a tiny room under the stairs, where no daylight came, and said to her, 'Many-furred Creature, you can live and sleep here.' Then she was sent into the kitchen, where she carried wood and water, poked the fire, washed vegetables, plucked fowls, swept up the ashes, and did all the dirty work.

Besides, she is a great strong girl, and a little rain will not hurt her, while my daughter would be sure to catch a bad cold.'\r\rBy long experience the man knew there was no good saying any more, and with a sigh he told the poor girl she must return to the forest for the axe.'That is a good girl,' said one; 'I really was too weak to stretch out a wing before she came. I should like to do something to show how grateful I am.'  'Well, let us give her a wreath of flowers that will never fade as long as she wears it,' cried another.  'And let the tiniest singing birds in the world sit amongst the flowers,' rejoined the third.  'Yes, that will do beautifully,' said the first. And when the girl stepped into her cottage a wreath of rosebuds was on her head, and a crowd of little birds were singing unseen.  The father, who was sitting by the fire, thought that, in spite of her muddy clothes, he had never seen his daughter looking so lovely; but the stepmother and the other girl grew wild with envy.'What in the world is the matter?' asked the birds sleepily.  'That is our secret,' said the doves.  Meanwhile the girl had reached home crosser than ever; but as soon as her mother heard her lift the latch of the door she ran out to hear her adventures. 'Well, did you get the wreath?' cried she.  'Dirty creatures!' answered her daughter.  'Don't speak to me like that! What do you mean?' asked the mother again.  'Dirty creatures!' repeated the daughter, and nothing else could she say.  Then the woman saw that something evil had befallen her, and turned in her rage to her stepdaughter.'You are at the bottom of this, I know,' she cried; and as the father was out of the way she took a stick and beat the girl till she screamed with pain and went to bed sobbing.  If the poor girl's life had been miserable before, it was ten times worse now, for the moment her father's back was turned the others teased and tormented her from morning till night; and their fury was increased by the sight of her wreath, which the doves had placed again on her head.The day after her marriage the bride sent a messenger, bearing handsome presents to her father, and telling him of the good fortune which had befallen her. As may be imagined, the stepmother and her daughter were so filled with envy that they grew quite ill, and had to take to their beds, and nobody would have been sorry it they had never got up again; but that did not happen. At length, however, they began to feel better, for the mother invented a plan by which she could be revenged on the girl who had never done her any harm.Everything fell out exactly as the woman had hoped. By the aid of her magic mirror the witch beheld the new princess walking in her gardens in a dress of green silk, and in a few minutes had produced a mask so like her, that very few people could have told the difference. However, she counselled the woman that when her daughter first wore it-for that, of course, was what she intended her to do-she had better pretend that she had a toothache, and cover her head with a lace veil. The woman thanked her and paid her well, and returned to her hut, carrying the mask under her cloak.In a few days she heard that a great hunt was planned, and the prince would leave the palace very early in the morning, so that his wife would be alone all day. This was a chance not to be missed, and taking her daughter with her she went up to the palace, where she had never been before. The princess was too happy in her new home to remember all that she had suffered in the old one, and she welcomed them both gladly, and gave them quantities of beautiful things to take back with them. At last she took them down to the shore to see a pleasure boat which her husband had had made for her; and here, the woman seizing her opportunity, stole softly behind the girl and pushed her off the rock on which she was standing, into the deep water, where she instantly sank to the bottom. Then she fastened the mask on her daughter, flung over her shoulders a velvet cloak, which the princess had let fall, and finally arranged a lace veil over her head.",

The father, knowing from experience that arguing was futile, reluctantly sends his daughter back to the forest. Upon completing her task, magical doves, grateful for her help, decide to reward her kindness. They gift her with a wreath of flowers that would never fade as long as she wore it, and tiny singing birds nestled among the blooms. When she returns home, despite her muddy appearance, her father notices an unprecedented loveliness about her, while her stepmother and stepsister are consumed with jealousy. The stepsister attempts to receive the same gifts but returns home only able to say 'Dirty creatures!' repeatedly. When questioned by her mother about the wreath, she can offer no other response, leading the enraged stepmother to blame and violently beat her stepdaughter while the father is away. The stepdaughter's life, already difficult, becomes exponentially worse as she faces constant torment from her stepfamily, particularly aggravated by the magical wreath that the doves continuously restore to her head. Eventually, fortune smiles upon the stepdaughter as she marries well and becomes a princess. She sends generous gifts to her father and shares news of her good fortune, causing her stepmother and stepsister to fall so ill with envy that they take to their beds. The stepmother, refusing to accept defeat, devises a vengeful plan. She consults a witch who, using a magic mirror, creates a perfect mask resembling the princess after seeing her walking in her garden wearing green silk. The witch advises them to cover the mask with a lace veil, using a toothache as an excuse. When the prince announces a hunting expedition, the stepmother sees her opportunity. Taking advantage of the princess being alone, she and her daughter visit the palace for the first time. The princess, having found such happiness in her new life that she's forgotten her past sufferings, welcomes them warmly and generously shares her beautiful possessions. While showing them her pleasure boat by the shore, the stepmother pushes the unsuspecting princess into deep water.

He was a most unpleasant customer to deal with, and he was more grasping and greedy than the folk of the Northland are, as a rule, though it is only too rare to find them unblessed with these attractive qualities. The other, Lucky Andrew, was wild and high spirited, but always good natured, and no matter how badly off he might be, he would always insist that he had been born under a lucky star. When the eagle, in order to defend his nest, belabored his head and face till the blood ran, he would still maintain that he was born under a lucky star, if only he managed to bring home a single eaglet. Did his boat capsize, which occasionally happened, and did they discover him hanging to it, quite overcome with the water, cold and exertion, and asked him how he felt, he would reply: \"O, quite well. I have been saved. I surely am in luck!\"But his brother complained of being weary, and at length they decided to remain there for the night. When Andrew awoke he found himself alone; and he saw neither brother nor boat, until he came to the highest point of the island. Then he discovered him far out, darting for land like a sea-gull. Andrew did not understand the whole affair. There were still provisions there, as well as a dish of curd, his gun and various other things. So Andrew wasted but little time in thought. \"He will come back this evening,\" said he. \"Only a fool loses heart so long as he can eat.\" But in the evening there was no brother to be seen, and Andrew waited day by day, and week by week; until at last, he realized that his brother had marooned him on this barren island in order to be able to keep their inheritance for himself, and not have to divide it.

But Paul met him with pleasant words.  \"Calm thyself, Brother,\" he said. \"It is true that I love the lady, but that is no proof that I shall win her. Is it likely that she will choose me, whom all men name Paul the Silent, when she hath the chance of marrying you, whose tongue moves so swiftly that to you is given the proud title of Harold the Orator?\"At these words Harold's vanity was flattered, and he thought that, after\rall, his step-brother was right, and that he had a very small chance,\rwith his meagre gift of speech, of being successful in his suit. So he\rthrew down his dagger, and, shaking hands with him, begged him to\rpardon his unkind thoughts, and went down the winding stair again in\rhigh good-humour with himself and all the world.\r\rBy this time it was coming near to the Feast of Yule, and at that\rFestival it was the custom for the Earl and his Court to leave Kirkwall\rfor some weeks, and go to the great Palace of Orphir, nine miles\rdistant. And in order to see that everything was ready, Earl Paul took\rhis departure some days before the others.\r\rThe evening before he left he chanced to find the Lady Morna sitting\ralone in one of the deep windows of the great hall.

Unbeknownst to the couple, their private moment had been observed by Paul's step-aunt, Countess Fraukirk, who had concealed herself behind a curtain in the hall, overhearing every word they exchanged.
